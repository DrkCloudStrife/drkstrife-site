    Wow how fast has time passed. It's been a little over a year since I wrote
    or touched this project. A lot has happened during that time, I never
    got to finish that side project I was working on, slowly learning Japanese,
    I got engaged! and my (hopefully) soon to be waifu made this beautiful Mei
    amigurumi for me. She really is A-Mei-Zing, if you like the Mei doll, you 
    should check out her other projects. Visit #{link_to "Saekoi's Shop", "https://www.facebook.com/SaekoiShop", target: :_blank, rel: :nofollow}

    I'm still working full time at #{link_to "BenchPrep", "https://benchprep.com", target: :_blank}, we have
    our own office! and our team is solid and strong as ever. I've been playing
    #{link_to "Overwatch", "https://playoverwatch.com", target: :_blank, rel: :nofollow} from time to time on my spare time,
    as well as #{link_to "Destiny", "https://www.destinythegame.com", target: :_blank, rel: :nofollow} and other games from
    my ever-growing vault, because a list is no longer enough, of video games.

    Some may have noticed in the navigation that I added a [#{t('navigation.projects')}](#{projects_path})
    tab, that's my little workshop where I will be putting prototypes, and
    other code snippets that have helped me along the way. I created a small
    easter for my company, so I will see if it's ok for me to copy the code to
    my projects tabs and just keep improving on it, but more on that on a 
    future update.
