I mean, just look at their site and compare to mine. Nothing alike, I swear!\r\n\r\n Just kidding, I did took a lot of ideas from their sites to build my page as it currently is, but that doesn't mean is final. As I mentioned in my previous post, I will slowly start enhancing the site.  A few of the things I want to add are:\r\n\r\n * Responsiveness (for mobile devices)\r\n * Internationalization  (for funsies)\r\n * Pagination (for when I hit article #15!)\r\n * Categories (to separate work from fun)",
