  "markdown": "I finally got to play [Battlefield Hardline](http://www.battlefield.com/hardline) with friends on the xbox one and I gotta say it's pretty fun. I'm a big Battlefield fan ever since I started playing Battlefield 2 for PC. I have always stayed within the PC realm on this type of game because it always felt more of a tactical game compared to other FPS games, not to mention better accuracy due to the mouse.\r\n\r\n Anyway, I just want to point out that I've played both PC and xbox one versions and I enjoy both equally. I'm already used to playing PC games without friends since everyone is on console, but I can't see myself enjoying this game on a console without any of my friends playing it. I do like that the game is in a much faster pace compared to other Battlefield games, but not too fast to be annoying. One of the main differences that I felt while playing the game on console, over the PC, is that there was this lack of teamwork with random players. At least on the PC, I felt there was more competitiveness on both ends and better teamwork regarless of not everyone using their mics.\r\n\r\n Will I be getting it day one? ~~Probably not, but I will at some point.~~ I have already preordered it as most of my friends already bought it heh.  I'm pretty excited about this game, and I hope it doesn't disappoints me, only sad part is that GTA V Heists is coming right around the corner :(\r\n\r\n Either way, I'm sure I'll be playing all of my other games so I won't get bored easily :D\r\n\r\n",
