  "markdown": "Wow how fast has time passed. It's been a little over a year since I wrote or touched this project. A lot has happened during that time, I never got to finish that side project I was working on, slowly learning Japanese, I got engaged! and my (hopefully) soon to be waifu made this beautiful Mei amigurumi for me. She really is A-Mei-Zing, if you like the Mei doll, you should check out her other projects. Visit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaekoiShop\" target=\"_blank\">Saekoi's Shop</a>\r\n\r\n I'm still working full time at <a href=\"https://benchprep.com\" target=\"_blank\">BenchPrep</a>, we have our own office! and our team is solid and strong as ever. I've been playing <a href=\"https://playoverwatch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Overwatch</a> from time to time on my spare time, as well as <a href=\"https://www.destinythegame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Destiny</a> and other games from my ever-growing vault, because a list is no longer enough, of video games.\r\n\r\n Some may have noticed in the navigation that I added a [Projects](/projects) tab, that's my little workshop where I will be putting prototypes, and other code snippets that have helped me along the way. I created a small easter for my company, so I will see if it's ok for me to copy the code to my projects tabs and just keep improving on it, but more on that on a future update.",
