  Welcome to my page. My name is Eduardo and this is my personal page.

  This site will be my little playground. I will use it for personal projects,
  as well as experiments so expect to see a little bit of everything.
  I mostly work with ruby on rails applications but I like to experiment
  with javascript and single-page apps too. When I'm not working on code
  I like to spend my day playing board games as well as video games
  (hence another reason why I took so long to get my page started).
