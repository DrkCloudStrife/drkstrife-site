  This is my first attempt to try to build a javascript maze. Though I didn't
  properly planned it, so it's all over the place. I don't think I will ever
  finish it, but I'm keeping it as a reference for future projects. I did
  learned a lot of things while building this prototype, It also helped me
  structure my javascript better.
