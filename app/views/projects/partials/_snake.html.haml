  This snake game was my first canvas project. I built this for BenchPrep as
  an easter egg back in 2014. It was a small gesture that we added for people
  that were interested in the game center and took the time to visit the
  leaderboards. I didn't just copy and pasted this back from the original
  code I wrote, I've actually rewritten it from scratch to fix some of the
  issues that the existing game has. I hope you enjoy~ :)
